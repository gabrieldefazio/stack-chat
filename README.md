# StackChat

A multi-room, dynamic react chat application.
#### Visit the deployed app[ on Heroku!](https://stackchat-app.herokuapp.com)

## Setting up
* get a mapbox api key by visiting [here](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/).
* `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
* `npm run seed`
* `npm start`

The `start` command will run both the `webpack` process (in watch mode) to build you client-side javascript files, and the Node process for your server with `nodemon`.
